# autosmart_v2

Automation solution for placement project to improve test coverage. The brief for this project was to create a program
that is able to run stream tests. This program follows test steps within a specific test. 
It outputs a pass or fail per step allowing the program to determine whether the overall test has passed or not.

The main task for this project was to automate the 4 key procedures that are used in any
AdSmart test:
• Play out the specific stream needed for the test. This was done using a service
• Remote control commands
• Extract the reports from the box. This was also done using a service
• Verification from the reports that the box has recorded the correct information in
its html report

Once the procedures had been automated, I then adapted the script to allow for more
than one box to run at a time. Allowing the 4 STB platforms to run in parallel. Which is a
local set up for a tester. AutoSmart was then able to run in addition to the
manual Testers.
